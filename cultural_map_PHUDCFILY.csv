Kensington is famous for the place to get your fix; and for the place you end up stuck when you’ve let your vices get the best of you.
For the last five years, Philly-based photographer Jeffrey Stockbridge has been taking intimate portraits of current residents (‘survivors’) in Kensington. But the stories he finds here aren't just about Philly: Jeffrey's photographs and raw interviews show a side of the desperation, hopelessness, and broken dreams that plague America's addicts across the country.
Through a walk with Jeffrey on the Avenue, we get a glimpse of what it's like to survive on Kensington."
